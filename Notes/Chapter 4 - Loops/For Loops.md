# For Loops 
For loops are like a while loop but it keeps the condition all in the same place, rather than having the condition be based on a seperate variable 
```java
while (condition) // condition is something true or false
{
    // do something
}

for (//initalize; condition; increment )
{
    // do something
}
```
For loops work in a very specific order, that you have to understand. <br>
First it will start with the initialization, then it will check the condition and if the condition is true, the program will do something then it will go to the increment, after the increment it will check to condition again and if it is still true it will do the thing again.

In general we tend to use a for loop when we are counting. Counting up or down from something
